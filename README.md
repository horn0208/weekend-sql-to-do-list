# SQL To-Do List

## Description

_Duration: 1 Week_

This is a To-do list app that allows user-created tasks to be stored in a SQL database. Tasks may be created, updated (marked complete), or deleted by the user, and any of these changes will be reflected both in the database and on the front end.

Buttons and inputs were styled using Bootstrap. Clicking 'Delete' will trigger a SweetAlert modal pop-op to confirm the action. Tasks may be sorted by completion status by clicking the 'Sort by status' button.
